Simple Twitter image finder that makes HTML pages. Put account URLs in `accounts.txt`.

`twitnon.py` does the scraping, `twitnon.sh` runs `twitnon.py` and puts it in a directory with a timestamp. See `twitnon.py --help` for advanced usage.

There's a javascript system for tagging images in the generated pages, but it isn't documented.

This script was made to find Undertale art and put it on [https://twitnon.surge.sh](https://twitnon.surge.sh).
